# Flagclash inventories

hi guys whats up. the site is at https://my-cool-githuub-usrname.github.io/FC_Invs/


this was built using the inventory rendering from PrismarineJS's repo: https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-inventory-gui  
i used textures from https://mc.nerothe.com/ to have the block textures be isometric. the program now expects 64x64 textures
