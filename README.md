# Flagclash inventories

hi guys whats up

most of the inventory rendering is from PrismarineJS's repo: https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-inventory-gui  

i used textures from https://mc.nerothe.com/, who rendered all the block textures to be isometric, like it is in-game. the program now uses 64x64 textures instead of 16x16 textures
